The years have not been kind to this place, however it has not prevented wild animals from electing it as a nesting ground. Indeed, you can see several places on the empty shelves where birds have put together nests made of cans, wire and all other sorts of human made things. There used to be stairs leading up, but the stairs have fallen since. Whatever was up there is no longer accessible.
