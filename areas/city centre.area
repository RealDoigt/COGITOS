You arrive in the city centre. There is no doubt that in the distant past, this part of the city thrived. Witnesses of a glorious past, the derelict buildings which dot the streets are in a such a state of disrepair they are barely standing and many have already crumbled to dust. Radioactive wastes block the access to the southern part of the city. To the west, the forest has reclaimed its birthright. This only leaves out the eastern and northern parts of the city to explore, although there is not much left to see... About the only things still 'intact' are the supermarket and what can be presumed to be a hotel; the sign fell off. There is a smashed and rotting banana at your feets.
