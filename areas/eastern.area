battle
city centre,the singing binks
nothing
To the east of the city lies the sea, the beach, the palm trees, the tourist attractions, the fancy restaurants. Or so it used to be. The palm trees are unrecognisable at first glance. Even the wind has changed; it carries the putrid scent of the polluted ocean water. There are tell tale signs of a bygone era of human carefree and careless activities, such as the beaches full of plastic bags, old electronics, debris and garbage. Amidst all of that which would make mother nature cry stands an odd building. Somehow, "The Singing Binks" was spared the ill fate of the rest of the city. The building's design cries for attention: a rainbow bears the letters of its name, a grinning skull crossed by musical notes sit upon the same rainbow.
